		<h1>Lab 13: Debugging</h1>
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>There weren't any challenges really with debugging my code. The only lab that I needed to debug is my Lab 8, which was a quick fix.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>I checked all of my previous labs by looking into the console to see if any errors showed up. The only lab that needed fixing was my Lab 8. When loading my page for Lab 8, the tests I ran from my JavaScript showed up, but not the page for my lab. I checked in my console, to see if any errors showed up, but there were no errors that appeared. I then used the debugging method in which you write debugg; in your JavaScript code, but that didn't work. I then asked my partner if I could take a look at his code to see what I might have done wrong. I then noticed that in my function firstThing(test) I wrote document.writeln instead of console.log. I'm not sure as to why I made this mistake since it told me in the instructions to use console.log, but I fixed this minor mistake.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>There are no results, since there was nothing new to code, however, the "Debugging" section below has all my work that I have debugged.</p>
		<h2>Debugging</h2>
		<p>Here are photos of my code and my working output from Lab 8.</p>
