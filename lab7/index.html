		<h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>We didn't really face any challenges. The only thing is that my partner was having the output text repeat itself, which he soon figured out. As for me there weren't any challenges.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>The only problem I faced was that my javascript wasn't showing up at all at first, but then I checked the code and found an error on one of the lines. Christian then pointed out to me that I had accidently put the variable UserName instead of nameArray on line 16.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Here are my results!</p>
