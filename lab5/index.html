	<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<div class="innerPadding">
			<p> This assignment was pretty straightforward and brief. My partner and I worked well together on it. I wouldn't say there were neccessarily any challenges, just some minor problems regarding the console and about the boolean, which we figured out in good time.</p>
		</div>
	<h2>Problems</h2>
		<div class="innerPadding">
			<p>The only problem, which was frustrating was Scripting on the console, which on my end didn't work. Not really sure what the problem is, but my partner and I collaborated together to put all the information while thoroughly reading the instructions. To help resolve this we just worked on it in my partner's console.</p>
