		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>For this assignment my partner and I had to create a form that takes the user's name (input) and to sort the letters in the person's name and to print it to the page. Unlike Lab 7 this was achieved using a form, instead of using window.prompt(). The challenge was to take Lab 7 and to make the user's name sorted to appear in the output. I think one challenge, which I have been noticing, is trying to understand each others' code, because my partner and I both approached the assignment very differently. I used document.getElementById inside of function sortUserName to return the value of the username, which my partner did very differently.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>One real issue that I faced with my code was when I tested it out in my console. Errors appeared when using a dash for my id's. Not sure why, but I changed it to letters only and no errors were appearing until after then. I am a little disappointed I didn't have enough time to complete the Task X: Bonus assignment and I hope from now on I will be able to experiement more with my code.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Type your name in the box below and your name will be spit out sorted alphabetically.</p>
		<form>
			<label>Input your name: </label>
			<input type="text" id="username" name="username">
			<input type="button" id="myButton" name="myButton" value="Button"><br><br>
		</form>
