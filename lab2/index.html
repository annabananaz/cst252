			<!--About me and my partner-->
			<p class="indent">My partner and I will tell you a little bit about ourselves. My name is Julianna Woldstad and my partner is Christian Tidwell. We are both Communication Design majors at CSU Monterey Bay. Something interesting is that we are both taking this class again together. Although we have different Major concentrations, we both share a love for developing games.Thanks for letting us share about ourselves! </p>
