	<h1>File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
	<h2>Difficulties Encountered</h2>
	<p>In all honesty, I didn't encounter any problems. In the beginning I had to rearrange my files a little bit, but after updating the new links, I didn't encounter any issues. As for my partner, though, he encountered an issue which we both worked together to resolve. He kept reloading his page, but none of the changes he made to his html, were showing up. I suggested he clear his browser's cashe. Then we looked at the link of his file and made sure he was updating the right file. Soon after he discovered that his files had been rearranged and he was reloading the file, which had been moved.</p>
	<h2>Results, Results</h2>
	<p>For the landing page, as instructed, I briefly wrote an introduction about myself and added a picture of myself, and with the help of my partner, Christian, I added all the links to my Lab File 
	Structures. In this process, everything went decently smoothly, unlike my work before from Lab 2.</p>
