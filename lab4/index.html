	<h1>Lab 4: Pseudocoding & Problem Solving</h1><br>
	<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<div class="white top" >
			<p> Honestly we didn't have too many challenges working on the assignment when we were writing the instructions for JavaScript. However, there were some issues uploading the images, which weren't showing up at first. To fix this though one of us put the image in Photoshop and saved the .jpg file instead as a .png. This was an easy fix.

	<h2>Problems</h2>
		<div class="white top">
		 	<p> Other than having trouble uploading the images to the page, there weren't any problems. There were some minor issues having the style show up, but nothing significant to take note of.
