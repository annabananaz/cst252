		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>My partner & I didn't face any challenges. We both looked at each others code and made sure we both cleared up any confusion.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>The only problem I faced was the JavaScript not showing up in my console at first. There was nothing wrong with my code, but I changed my settings in the console to default and then it started showing up just fine.</p>
		<h2>Resubmission</h2>
		<p>When loading my page for Lab 8, the tests I ran from my JavaScript showed up, but not the page for my lab. I checked in my console, to see if any errors showed up, but there were no errors that appeared. I then used the debugging method in which you write debugg; in your JavaScript code, but that didn't work. I then asked my partner if I could take a look at his code to see what I might have done wrong. I then noticed that in my function firstThing(test) I wrote document.writeln instead of console.log. The reason this did not work was because it was printing my code to the page, over writing my html, instead of logging it to the console.</p>
