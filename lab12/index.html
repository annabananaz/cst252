		<h1>Lab 12: Loops</h1>
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>The real challenge wasn't necessarily figuring out the JavaScript for outputting Fizz, Buzz, and Boom, but figuring out just how to organize the output into columns. Unfortunately as much as I tried and for how long I searched, I couldn't figure out how to put the output into columns. Although I won't earn the grade for it, I will come back to this once I figure it out, and organize my content into columns.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>When writing my code there were a few minor issues. One of the issues was that at first my code wasn't showing up on the page. My friend Jayson took a look at my code and pointed out that I didn't put defer, so my output wasn't loading to the page. Another minor mistake I made was having return outputStr inside of the for loop which I moved to be inside of function fizzBuzz(). Other than that, the instructions were clear and I had a good grasp of what I was doing. </p>
