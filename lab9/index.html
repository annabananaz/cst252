		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>The challenge we faced was understanding the instructions in Task 1. My partner and I wrote our code differently and I was confused as to why he put the div tag instead of the id output. I think the bolding of the div in the instructions made it a little confusing, but I pointed out to my partner that we are using getElementById() and not getElementByTag. To help clear up the confusion, I called my friend Jason over and confirmed that you put the name of the id and not the div. It was all just a misunderstanding that was resolved. I think possibly another challenge was me not having a good enough understanding of how DOM works in the beginning, but I looked at it on W3Schools until I had a solid enough understanding of DOM.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>The only problem we faced, as previously mentioned, was being confused exactly on what to do at first, but we figured it out together and began to gain a better understanding of how DOM works.
